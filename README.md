Hi, My Name is Muhammad Nidzam bin Maso'od.  
Currently I'm pursuing my Msc in Business Intelligence and Analytics at Advanced Informatics School ,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.  
This website is collections of codes and analytics samples done during the course of my study.  

### A bit about Master Of Science (Business Intelligence and Analytics).
The purpose of this academic programme is to produce ICT professionals with knowledge and advanced skills in Business Intelligence, Data Science and Analytics. Students will acquire knowledge and skills in data manipulation and data analysis (especially in Big Data) which will enable students to perform as the experts in Business Intelligence or Data Science by designing and implementing analytical activities, in which will promote organizational transformation.  

This academic programme (Business Intelligence and Analytics – BI&A) can be described as the Data Science for business, in which it introduces the importance of data in the business world by presenting the principals of data governance (overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data employed in an enterprise), fundamental principles of data science, and techniques to extract necessary useful knowledge and business value from multiple sources of data. A survey by Gartner (CIO 2013) concludes that “BI&A was ranked as the CIOs’ number one technology priority; a position it has occupied in three of the last ﬁve years”. Thus, this academic programme will emphasize on the balance between Business Intelligence, Data Science and Big Data Analytics to produce highly capable Business Intelligence Analysts or Data Scientists.
